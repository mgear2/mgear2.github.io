## Industry Experience

### Devops Intern at Tripwire Inc, July 2019 - December 2019

- Built a modular library and corresponding command-line tool using Go with the objective of automating cloud deployments at scale. The library leveraged vSphere APIs to allow a user to easily deploy hundreds or thousands of VMs of any given number and variety while also handling configuration via Chef. The library was built in a modular fashion to enable future use through a web portal, future expansion to AWS, and use with additional configuration management tools.

- Worked closely as part of the Performance and Automation Team to gather requirements, select languages, libraries and frameworks, and execute the project using version controlled repositories with team-reviewed pull requests, pipeline automation, and thorough unit testing.

### Devops Intern at Viewpoint Software, January 2019 - June 2019
