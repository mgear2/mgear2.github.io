I am a Software Engineer with a passion for building well documented, thoroughly tested, eminently usable applications. I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Portland State University in summer 2020, alongside 18 months of professional Software Engineering internship experience. Following that I have worked at Amazon for over two years on the Grocery Personalization team, during which time I have delivered many valuable projects and gained a promotion to SDE2. I am a life-long learner who views Software Engineering as my trade and I am adept at working hard both independently and as part of a passionate, collaborative team.
