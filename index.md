# Introduction

My name is Matthew Geary, a Software Engineer with a passion for building well documented, thoroughly tested, eminently usable applications. I recently completed a Master's degree in Computer Science at Portland State University, alongside 18 months of professional Software Engineering internship experience. I am a life-long learner who views Software Engineering as my trade and I am adept at working hard both independently and as part of a passionate, collaborative team.
