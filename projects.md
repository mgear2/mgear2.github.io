## Undervoid 

![undervoidtitle](assets/img/undervoidtitle.png)

Undervoid is a very-much-under-development dungeon crawler/bullet hell/rpg-lite experience being developed as a collaborative open source software project using pygame. Choose one of several wacky characters and venture, in search of glory and treasure, into the Undervoid, an interdemensional rift beneath the world where the laws of nature and time lose all meaning and enemies lurk around every corner.
